## ðŸ§  TPU-Gen Framework Overview

TPU-Gen is the first end-to-end framework that uses fine-tuned LLMs with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to generate both **exact and approximate TPU architectures**.

It consists of:

1. Prompt generation from user input.

2. LLMs enhanced with multi-shot learning.

3. RAG module for dependency fetching.

4. Automated design validation and PPA reporting.
