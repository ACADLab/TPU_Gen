## 🧠 TPU-Gen Framework Overview

TPU-Gen is the first end-to-end framework that uses fine-tuned LLMs with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to generate both **exact and approximate TPU architectures**.

It consists of:

- ✅ Prompt generation from user input
- ✅ LLMs enhanced with multi-shot learning
- ✅ RAG module for dependency fetching
- ✅ Automated design validation and PPA reporting
